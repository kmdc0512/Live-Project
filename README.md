          <br>
          <p>During my time with The Tech Academy I worked on a 2 week sprint live project following the Scrum ideology. Along with fellow colleagues, we helped solve real world 
            problems and communicated our daily progress. We worked as a collective but were assigned individual tasks catering to our respective skills. I was assigned offensive 
            and defensive security challenges such as analyzing malware traffic, penetration testing, inspecting pcap files and finding vulnerabilities in applications. 
            Some of these challenges called for tools and techniques such as Wireshark, Burp Suite, SQL injections and privilege escalation attacks to name a few.</p>

          <p><i>Most of these challenges I completed via VM VirtualBox using Kali Linux</i></p>

          <p><i>I utilized  the Burp Suite repeater tool to perform a privilege escalation attack.</i></p>
